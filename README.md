# IG–Telegram Integration

Bridge between an Instagram professional account's DMs and a private Telegram group.
Incoming Instagram DMs are forwarded to Telegram; union members reply from Telegram and
the reply is sent back to the Instagram user. AI-suggested replies are planned but **not
yet implemented** — see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md).

## Status

| Piece | State |
|-------|-------|
| IG auth (Instagram Login, `graph.instagram.com`) | ✅ working |
| Inbound DM (text + media) via `messages` webhook | ✅ working (real users, no App Review — own account) |
| Per-user Telegram forum topics | ✅ |
| Reply from Telegram → IG (`/me/messages`) | ✅ |
| Reaction passthrough (Telegram → IG) | ✅ |
| Moderation/ops commands (block, prune, health, …) | ✅ |
| Persistence (SQLite on a Fly volume) | ✅ |
| Deploy (Fly.io, ~64 MB image) | ✅ |
| AI-suggested replies (Claude) | ⏳ deferred |

## How it works

```
IG user DMs the account (text or media)
  → Meta webhook → POST /webhook   (signature-verified)
  → stored in SQLite, forwarded into that user's Telegram forum topic
  → member types a reply inside the topic
  → reply sent to the IG user via graph.instagram.com/me/messages (24h window)
```

- **One topic per IG user**, named `Name (@username)`, created on first DM (auto-recreated if deleted).
- Routing is by the topic's `message_thread_id` → IGSID (persisted in SQLite), so replies reach the right user.
- **Media** (image/video/audio/file) is downloaded and re-uploaded into the topic; shares/links fall back to a link.
- **Attention = open/closed topic**: a topic stays open while it needs the team and closes when you mark it resolved with `/read`; a new DM reopens it, so handled chats leave the active list. Replies keep it open (for follow-ups); command acks self-delete so the preview stays the real conversation.
- An **emoji reaction** on a forwarded message is mirrored onto the IG message.

## Commands

`/help` `/general` (reply to a message → copy it to #General with a back-link) `/read` `/unread`
(close as resolved / reopen as pending) `/block` `/unblock` (soft-ignore a user, not blocked on IG)
`/health` (bot + IG token status) `/prune` (delete topics inactive > 1 year) `/id` (chat id).

## Setup — step by step

Requires Node 20+. Assumes you already have a Meta app (Instagram API with Instagram Login)
and know where to find/add its credentials — see [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) for the
Meta-side details and constraints.

### 1. Install deps

```bash
yarn install      # or: npm install
```

`better-sqlite3` compiles natively — needs Xcode Command Line Tools on macOS.

### 2. Fill the Instagram credentials in `.env`

```
META_APP_ID=         # your Meta/Instagram app id
META_APP_SECRET=     # used to verify the x-hub-signature-256 webhook signature
IG_ACCESS_TOKEN=     # IGAA… user token (App Dashboard → Instagram → Generate token)
IG_ACCOUNT_ID=       # informational; the token resolves the account itself
VERIFY_TOKEN=        # any random string; must match the Meta webhook config below
```

### 3. Create the bot (BotFather)

- DM **@BotFather** → `/newbot` → name it → copy the token.

### 4. Create the supergroup + get its id

- Create a private group, **enable Topics** (converts it to a supergroup), and add the bot
  as **admin with "Manage Topics"** (needed to create/rename/delete per-user topics).
- Start the server (step 6), then type **`/id`** in the group → bot replies `chat id: -100…`.

### 5. Add the Telegram values to `.env`

```
TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN=<from BotFather>
TELEGRAM_CHAT_ID=<the id from /id>
# PORT=3000        # optional
# DB_PATH=data.db  # optional
```

### 6. Run + expose

```bash
yarn start                                       # node --env-file=.env index.js
cloudflared tunnel --url http://localhost:3000   # new terminal — public HTTPS for the webhook
```

Point the Meta app's webhook callback to `https://<tunnel>/webhook` with your `VERIFY_TOKEN`
and subscribe to the **`messages`** field. The quick-tunnel URL changes on every restart —
re-paste it into the dashboard when it does.

### 7. Test the round-trip

```bash
yarn selftest    # offline: signature, topic/reply routing, blocklist, unread, prune, reactions
```

End-to-end:
- Real DM to the IG account → a topic `Name (@username)` appears (open), with the message inside.
- **Type a reply inside that topic** → the IG user receives it; the topic stays open. Type `/read` to close it once resolved.
- Outside 24h of their last message → bot posts `❌ IG send failed` (expected Meta limit).

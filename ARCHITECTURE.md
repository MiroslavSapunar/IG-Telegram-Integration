# IG-Telegram Integration — Architecture Document

## Problem

University student union IG account (10.4k followers) receives high volume of DMs. Multiple union members share access to the account, making DM management chaotic and uncoordinated.

## Solution

A bridge between Instagram DMs and a private Telegram group, with AI-assisted reply suggestions. Union members review, edit, and approve replies from Telegram before they're sent back via Instagram.

## Flow

Current (implemented, no AI yet):

1. DM arrives on Instagram
2. Meta sends a `messages` webhook to our server
3. Server verifies the signature, acks HTTP 200, stores the message in SQLite
4. Server forwards the DM — text **and media** (image/video/audio/file) — into that user's Telegram **forum topic** (created on first contact, named `❗ Name (@username)`, branded with a topic icon), **reopening** it if it was closed (open / ❗ = needs attention)
5. A union member types a reply **inside that topic** (it stays open for follow-ups; `/resuelto` closes it once resolved); emoji reactions sync both ways between the forwarded/replied message and its IG counterpart
6. Server maps the topic to the sender's IGSID and sends it back via the IG API (within the 24h window)

Planned (Phase 4): before step 4, Claude reads the message + FAQ context and the forwarded
card carries an AI-suggested reply the member can approve or edit.

## Tech Stack

| Component  | Choice                                                          |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------|
| Runtime    | Node.js 20+ (ESM, plain JS — no TypeScript build step)          |
| Hosting    | Fly.io (Docker + a small volume for the SQLite file)            |
| IG         | Instagram API with Instagram Login (`graph.instagram.com` v25.0)|
| Telegram   | `grammy` (long-polling)                                         |
| AI         | Claude API (`@anthropic-ai/sdk`) — planned                      |
| Storage    | SQLite via `better-sqlite3` (message log with timestamps)       |

Dependency choices are deliberately minimal: native `node:http` for the webhook, `grammy`
for the bot, `better-sqlite3` for storage. No web framework, no ORM.

## Instagram API Constraints

- **API flavor**: **Instagram API with Instagram Login** — base URL `graph.instagram.com`, version `v25.0`. NOT the Facebook-Page/Graph route (no FB Page required).
- **Account**: Must be Instagram Business or Creator (no Facebook Page link needed for this flavor)
- **Permissions required**: `instagram_business_basic`, `instagram_business_manage_messages` (also `instagram_business_manage_comments` configured)
- **Access token**: Instagram User token (`IGAA...`), generated via App Dashboard → Instagram → API setup with Instagram business login → **Generate token**. Dashboard tokens last 60 days. (Graph API Explorer is the wrong tool — it issues FB/app tokens.)
- **Rate limit**: 200 DMs/hour
- **Messaging window**: 24h to reply (extendable with `human_agent` permission)
- **Webhook**: Must respond HTTP 200 within 30 seconds; payloads are signed `x-hub-signature-256: sha256=<hmac>` with the app secret. Subscribe to **`messages`** *and* the **message-reactions** field — reactions arrive as a separate webhook field, so without it IG-user reactions never reach the bot
- **Publishing**: the app must be **Live/published** to receive real webhooks — this only needs basic settings + a privacy-policy URL
- **App Review**: NOT required for the union's own account (direct-developer / Standard Access path). Advanced Access via App Review is only needed to serve accounts you don't own.

## Findings (verified 2026-06-18)

Confirmed by direct testing against the live `mli.fiuba` account:

- ✅ **Auth**: Instagram Login app + `IGAA...` token works; resolves to `mli.fiuba` (`user_id 17841407167444620`).
- ✅ **Reading DMs = webhook, not polling**: once the app is **published (Live)**, the `messages` webhook delivers real DMs from real (non-tester) users — no App Review for the own account. `GET /me/conversations` returns `[]` (event-driven API, not a historical inbox dump) and is unused.
- ✅ **Publishing ≠ App Review**: Live mode is a light gate (basic settings + privacy-policy URL). App Review (Advanced Access) is a separate, heavier gate not required here.
- 🔁 **Sending**: `POST /me/messages` replies to the `sender.id` (IGSID) from the webhook payload, within the 24h window.
- ⚙️ **Webhook quirks**: the dashboard "Test" button sends a *signed* sample (passes HMAC). The quick `cloudflared` tunnel URL changes on every restart — re-paste it into the dashboard.

**Implication**: the inbound path is webhook-first and already working end-to-end in dev. The
remaining work is hosting (stable URL) and the AI layer — not Meta approvals.

## Components

Everything runs in a single Node process, split into ES modules by scope: `index.js` (entry point —
HTTP webhook server + bootstrap + offline selftest), `config.js` (env + constants), `db.js` (SQLite
schema + prepared statements + blocklist), `instagram.js` (IG Graph client + webhook utils), and
`telegram.js` (grammy bot: commands, handlers, topic lifecycle, status report, 2h cron).

### 1. Webhook server (native `node:http`)
- `GET /webhook`: Meta verify-token handshake (echoes `hub.challenge`)
- `POST /webhook`: validates `x-hub-signature-256`, acks 200, forwards the DM to Telegram

### 2. Telegram bot (`grammy`, long-polling)
- Supergroup with **Topics** enabled; one **forum topic per IG user** (created on first DM, auto-recreated if deleted)
- Reply routing: a member typing in a topic → mapped via the topic's `message_thread_id` to the IGSID → sent to IG
- Media (image/video/audio/file) is downloaded and re-uploaded into the topic; shares/unknown/failures → labeled link
- Attention via topic **open/closed** + a ❗ name badge: open (❗) = needs the team, closed = resolved (`/resuelto`); a new DM reopens it, so handled conversations drop out of the active list. Replies keep the topic open (regulars can't post once it's closed, so closing is a deliberate `/resuelto`). The ❗ prefix and an icon are baked into the name at creation and the badge toggles only on open↔closed transitions (not per message); command acks + `/resuelto`/`/pendiente` self-delete so the preview stays the real conversation. `/resuelto` and `/pendiente` (on a real state transition) post a one-line audit note into General — `✅ <user> — resuelto por <miembro>` / `↩️ <user> — reabierto por <miembro>` — as a team-visible log of who closed/reopened what
- Reactions sync **both ways**: a member's reaction in Telegram → IG message (remove → unreact); an IG user's reaction (on their message or a member's reply) → the Telegram message, mapped to Telegram's fixed reaction set. Both directions need the `fwd` table to map IG message id ↔ Telegram message id (now stored for inbound *and* outbound)
- `/estado`: lists open topics with the time left on each one's IG 24h reply window (⚠️ <6h, ⛔ expired), most-urgent first; a `setInterval` posts it into General every 2h when anything is open
- Soft blocklist (drops messages before forwarding; not blocked on Instagram); `/bloquear`/`/desbloquear` post an audit note to General
- Requires the bot to be admin with "Manage Topics"
- `/respuestas`: per-member tally of messages sent in user topics (not General), top 10. Counts accrue from deploy onward (the `messages` table has no Telegram author, so no backfill)
- Commands (Spanish): `/ayuda` `/manual` (member guide) `/general` (copy to General with a back-link) `/resuelto` `/pendiente` `/estado` `/bloquear` `/desbloquear` `/bloqueados` `/respuestas` `/servercheck` `/purgar` `/id`
- Command scoping: info/report commands (`/ayuda` `/manual` `/servercheck` `/estado` `/bloqueados` `/respuestas` `/purgar` `/id`) only run in **General** (used inside a user topic they're dropped with a hint, via a `generalCommand` wrapper that checks `message_thread_id`); topic actions (`/resuelto` `/pendiente` `/bloquear` `/desbloquear` `/general`) only run inside a topic

### 3. Storage (SQLite, `better-sqlite3`, on the Fly volume at `/data/data.db` — survives deploys)
- `messages`: `igsid`, `direction` (in/out), `text`, `created_at` — conversation history (follow-ups + dates)
- `threads`: `igsid` ↔ `thread_id` (forum topic) + `unread` flag — persistent routing + marker state
- `blocked`: soft-blocked IGSIDs (also seedable via `BLOCKED_IGSIDS` env)
- `fwd`: Telegram message ↔ IG message id (`mid`) — inbound forwards *and* outbound replies — for two-way reaction sync
- `members`: Telegram `user_id` → message `count` in topics (not General), for `/respuestas`

### 4. Claude AI (planned, Phase 4)
- DM text + FAQ context → suggested reply shown in the Telegram card for approve/edit

### 5. FAQ storage (planned, Phase 4)
- Q&A pairs as context for Claude; start as a `.json` file, fold into SQLite if it grows

## Implementation Phases

- ✅ **Phase 2 — Instagram Webhook**: verify (GET) + signed event handler (POST), DM + media parsing.
- ✅ **Phase 3 — Telegram Bot**: BotFather bot, supergroup with per-user topics, IG DM → Telegram forwarding, moderation/ops commands.
- ✅ **Phase 5 — Reply Path**: member's Telegram reply → IG via `POST /me/messages`; reaction passthrough; messages persisted in SQLite.
- ✅ **Phase 6 — Deployment**: multi-stage Dockerfile (~64 MB) + Fly.io (single machine, SQLite on a volume, secrets, stable webhook URL).
- ✅ **Phase 7 — Triage UX & ops**: open/closed attention model with ❗ badge, two-way reaction sync, `/estado` (24h-window timers) + 2h General alert, `/bloqueados`, `/respuestas`, Spanish command names + `/manual` member guide; `index.js` split into `config`/`db`/`instagram`/`telegram` modules.
- ⏳ **Phase 4 — Claude AI**: Claude integration, FAQ context, suggested reply in the Telegram card.

(Phase 1's TypeScript/Express scaffold was dropped — native `http` + plain JS was enough.)

## Prerequisites (manual steps)

1. IG account is Business/Creator (no Facebook Page link needed for the Instagram Login flavor)
2. Meta app created, Instagram product = "API setup with Instagram business login"
3. App **published (Live)** with a privacy-policy URL (required to receive real webhooks)
4. Telegram bot via @BotFather + private group with the bot added
5. (Phase 4) Claude API key from console.anthropic.com
